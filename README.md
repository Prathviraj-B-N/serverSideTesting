Calculator Server-Side Web Applications Testing README
Project Overview:
This project focuses on testing a server-side calculator application using CIM (Computation-Independent Model), ATG (Application Test Generation), and end-to-end flow testing strategies. The goal is to model the server-side code interactions and create effective test cases for comprehensive coverage.

Steps to Follow:
1. Understanding and Modeling the Server-Side Code:
CIM Modeling:

Create a high-level model describing the functional aspects of the calculator application's server-side code.
Capture essential arithmetic operations, data flows, and internal calculations within the code.
ATG Model Generation:

Utilize the CIM to generate specific test models for the calculator application.
Include input conditions, expected outputs, and edge cases such as boundary values and exceptional scenarios.
Graphical Representation:

Develop visual graphs illustrating how the server-side code processes and responds to user input.
Depict the flow of calculations, data handling, and interaction with client requests.
2. Test Case Design for End-to-End Flow Testing:
Using Modeled CIM/ATG:

Design test cases based on the CIM and ATG models generated earlier.
Ensure coverage of arithmetic operations, error handling, boundary checks, and user input variations.
End-to-End Flow Testing:

Focus on testing the complete flow of interactions within the server-side code of the calculator application.
Validate arithmetic computations, handling of invalid inputs, and the response to various user scenarios.
3. Execution and Tool Selection:
Modeling and Testing Tools:
Choose tools suitable for CIM modeling (UML tools, specialized modeling software) and testing tools capable of executing test cases derived from the generated models.
Consider both manual and automated testing approaches based on the complexity of the calculator code.
4. Documentation and Reporting:
README and Documentation:

Create a comprehensive README file documenting the entire testing process for the calculator application.
Include details of the modeling approach, tools used, generated models, test case designs, and the execution process.
Graphical Representations and Results:

Incorporate graphical representations of CIM, ATG models, and interaction graphs related to the calculator application.
Provide detailed reports on test execution, anomalies detected, coverage achieved, and an overall assessment of the server-side calculator application's functionality.
